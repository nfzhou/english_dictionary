# english_dictionary
While searching for an English dictionary for a NLP project, I encountered https://github.com/dwyl/english-words. However, the words are not categorized. Many of the dictionaries I found online, such as OPTED and WordNet, only list stem words. This dictionary contains both stem and inflectional nouns and verbs.  Besides the OPTED and WordNet dictionaries, the following resources were used in the making of the files:

Pluralize nouns:  https://www.grammarly.com/blog/plural-nouns/

Irregular verbs: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_irregular_verbs

Conjugate verbs: https://conjugator.reverso.net/conjugation-irregular-verbs-english.html

The format is for the Picat language, and it can be easily converted to other languages.

The Copyrights belong to the creators of the original dictionaries.
